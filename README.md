# GO File Readers

Testing out file reading and writing in Golang.

Currently `main.go` contains a CSV reading script that prints out the first and last names of a given users.csv file. The script in `gff3.go` gets user-specified data (i.e. pseudogenes) from a given GFF3 file and writes it to a new file.
